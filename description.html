          >Writing a good job description is essential to help you attract the
          most qualified candidates for your job. With more than 20 million jobs
          listed on Indeed, a great job description can help your jobs stand out
          from the rest. Your job descriptions are where you present your
          company and your job to your future employee.

          >The key to writing effective job descriptions is to find the perfect
          balance between providing enough detail so candidates understand the
          role and your company, while keeping your description concise. We’ve
          found that job descriptions between 700 and 2,000 characters get up to
          30% more applications.*</pd1>

        <pd1 >
          <bb>Make your job titles specific.</bb> Informative job titles are more
          effective than general ones, so be precise by including key phrases
          that accurately describe the role.

        <pd1 >
          <bb>Avoid internal jargon that may confuse the job seeker. </bb>Stick to
          standard levels of experience like “Senior” rather than “Grade 6” or
          other terms people are less likely to look for.

        <br />
        <br />
        <pd1 >
          <bb>Outline the main responsibilities of the position.</bb> Make sure your list of responsibilities is detailed but concise. Also emphasize the duties that may be unique to your organization. For example, if you are hiring for an “Event Management” role, and the position requires social media expertise to promote events, include this detail to ensure candidates understand the requirements and can determine if they’re qualified. 
        </pd1>
        <br />
        <br />
        <pd1 >
          <bb>Describe the day-to-day activities of the position. </bb>This will help candidates understand the work environment and the activities they will be involved in on a daily basis. This level of detail will help the candidate decide if the role and company are right for them, and will help you attract the best candidates for your position.
        </pd1>
        <br />
        <br />
        <pd1 >
          <bb>Specify how the position fits into the organization.  </bb>Indicate the title of the manager the person will report to and how they will function within your organization, to help candidates see the bigger picture and understand how the role impacts the business.

        <br />
        <br />
        <pd1 >
          <bb>Include a list of hard and soft skills. </bb> Of course, the job description should specify education, previous job experience, certifications and technical skills required for the role. You may also include soft skills, like communication and problem-solving, as well as personality traits that you expect from a successful candidate.
        <br />
        <br />
        <pd1 >
          <bb>Keep your list concise. </bb>While you may be tempted to list every requirement you expect from for your ideal candidate, if you include too many qualifications and skills this could dissuade potential applicants.
